    <p class="lead">The Monographs collection, spanning three and a half centuries of Canadian documentary history, holds rich primary materials exploring a wide range of subjects and disciplines. With a projected 84,000 titles by completion, this resource is the most comprehensive full‑text searchable set of historical monographs currently available for the study of Canada.</p>

    <p>Topics range from major historical events to the development of institutions, laws and science; from Canadian literature to philosophical treatises; from agriculture to politics, trade and tariffs.</p>

    <p><strong>Size:</strong> 84,000 titles</p>

    <p><strong>Selection criteria:</strong> Canadian imprints (monographs and pamphlets) to 1920; selected works published outside the country, either by Canadian authors or relating to Canada, were also digitized. An advisory board of scholars and collection specialists guided development.</p>
